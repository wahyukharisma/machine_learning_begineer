Vectors describe spatial lines and planes, enabling you to perform calculations that explore relationships in multi-dimensional space.\n","\n","## What is a Vector\n","At its simplest, a vector is a numeric element that has both *magnitude* and *direction*. The magnitude represents a distance (for example, \"2 miles\") and the direction indicates which way the vector is headed (for example, \"East\"). Vectors are defined by an n-dimensional coordinate that describe a point in space that can be connected by a line from an arbitrary origin.\n","\n","That all seems a bit complicated, so let's start with a simple, two-dimensional example. In this case, we'll have a vector that is defined by a point in a two-dimensional plane: A two dimensional coordinate consists of an *x* and a *y* value, and in this case we'll use **2** for *x* and **1** for *y*.\n","\n","Our vector can be written as **v**=(2,1), but more formally we would use the following notation, in which the dimensional coordinate values for the vector are shown as a matrix:\n","\\begin{equation}\\vec{v} = \\begin{bmatrix}2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\end{equation}\n","\n","So what exactly does that mean? Well, the coordinate is two-dimensional, and describes the movements required to get to the end point (of *head*) of the vector - in this case, we need to move 2 units in the *x* dimension, and 1 unit in the *y* dimension. Note that we don't specify a starting point for the vector - we're simply describing a destination coordinate that encapsulate the magnitide and direction of the vector. Think about it as the directions you need to follow to get to *there* from *here*, without specifying where *here* actually is!\n","\n","It can help to visualize the vector, and with a two-dimensional vector, that's pretty straightforward. We just define a two-dimensional plane, choose a starting point, and plot the coordinate described by the vector relative to the starting point.\n","\n","Run the code in the following cell to visualize the vector **v** (which remember is described by the coordinate (2,1))."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"SHzQZi4Z0K3Q","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":289},"outputId":"ffc5febe-d9b0-4011-ff40-ae904d899ee4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1563160066173,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":928,"user":{"displayName":"ernawati
